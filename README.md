# Overview
This project was built as part of my learning journey to deepen my understanding of JavaScript, focusing on key concepts such as functions, DOM manipulation, and incorporating sounds into a web page using JavaScript. The project demonstrates how to build interactive elements on a website that respond to user actions by playing sounds and updating the DOM dynamically.

## Features
* JavaScript Functions: Utilized to handle various tasks like event listeners, sound playing, and DOM updates.
* DOM Manipulation: Interacted with HTML elements, modifying content and styles dynamically based on user inputs and events.
* Sound Integration: Added sound effects that are triggered by user actions like button clicks or keyboard presses.
## Technologies Used
* HTML: For structuring the web page.
* CSS: For styling and making the UI visually appealing.
* JavaScript: The core technology used to implement the logic, handle events, manipulate the DOM, and integrate sounds.
## Key Learning Outcomes
* JavaScript Functions: Explored how to write reusable code using functions, making the project modular and maintainable.
* Event Handling: Learned how to capture user inputs like clicks and keypresses to trigger corresponding actions.
* DOM Manipulation: Understood how to access and modify HTML elements in real time to create an interactive user experience.
* Sound Integration: Experimented with incorporating sound files and playing them based on events using JavaScript's Audio object.
